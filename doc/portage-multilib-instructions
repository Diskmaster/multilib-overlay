A basic way to use this branch:

First, install the modified portage version:
1. emerge -av1 portage
then add the new useflag to the database or compile everything with a new useflag:
2. run bin/add_lib32 or emerge -aDN world
to save some compile time, there is a list of packages, which are usually not needed for 32bit libs
either use the profile in /etc:
3. 
-check the target of /etc/make.profile, rm /etc/make.profile, mkdir /etc/make.profile,
	echo /path/to/current/profile >> /etc/make.profile/parent, echo /path/to/multilib-overlay/profiles/base >> /etc/make.profile/parent
OR
add the NO-AUTO-FLAG var to the portage environment (e.g. to /etc/make.conf):
-cat profiles/base/make.defaults >> /etc/make.conf
