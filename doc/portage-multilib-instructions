First, if you want to install and use it via layman:

layman -a multilib
cd $PORTDIR_OVERLAY/layman/multilib ($PORTDIR_OVERLAY is for most probably /usr/local/portage)
git checkout origin/portage-multilib
git checkout -b portage-multilib

After that, every layman sync should update the branch as normal, switching is done with

git checkout <branch>

with the main branches are master and portage-multilib

A basic way to use this branch:

First, install the modified portage version:

1.
emerge -av1 portage
then add the new useflag to the database or compile everything with a new useflag:

2.
run bin/add_lib32 or emerge -aDN world

3.
to save some compile time, there is a list of packages, which are usually not needed for 32bit libs
either use the profile in /etc:
	-check the target of /etc/make.profile, rm /etc/make.profile, mkdir /etc/make.profile,
	echo /path/to/current/profile >> /etc/make.profile/parent, echo /path/to/multilib-overlay/profiles/base >> /etc/make.profile/parent
OR
	add the NO-AUTO-FLAG var to the portage environment (e.g. to /etc/make.conf):
	-cat profiles/base/make.defaults >> /etc/make.conf

4.
let the multilib overlay eclasses override the main tree ones: add the following to /etc/portage/repos.conf or create it with the following content:

[DEFAULT]
eclass-overrides = gentoo multilib
[multilib]
eclass-overrides = gentoo multilib
