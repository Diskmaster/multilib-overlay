First, if you want to install and use it via layman:

layman -a multilib
cd $PORTDIR_OVERLAY/layman/multilib ($PORTDIR_OVERLAY is for most 
probably /usr/local/portage)
git checkout -b portage-multilib origin/portage-multilib

After that, every layman sync should update the branch as normal, 
switching is done with

git checkout <branch>

the main branches are master and portage-multilib

A basic way to use this branch:

First, install the modified portage version:

1.
emerge -av1 portage

2.
check the target of /etc/make.profile
rm /etc/make.profile
mkdir /etc/make.profile
echo /path/to/current/profile >> /etc/make.profile/parent
echo /path/to/multilib-overlay/profiles/base >> /etc/make.profile/parent

3.
let the multilib overlay eclasses override the main tree ones: add the 
following to /etc/portage/repos.conf or create it with the following
content:

[DEFAULT]
eclass-overrides = gentoo multilib
[multilib]
eclass-overrides = gentoo multilib

4.

then recompile world:

emerge -e world

(you can also use /bin/add_lib32 to add the useflag to the database,
but this branch does also remove all .la files, so you might have to
run revdep-rebuild or lafilefixer every time you built a package with 
multilib-portage)
