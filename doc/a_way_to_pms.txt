changes needed on the pm side:
run all functions until src_install twice while using completly independant
environment and workingdirs.
The last steps can be done with the environment of the default abi

build only the abi that is requested via useflags

the pm sets the useflags automatic to the dependencies

changes on ebuild side:
changes only needed for packages that have different includes/binarys which
are needed to build other packages




problems:
we need a mechanism to wrap binarys to reduce changes to
ebuild/configure-scripts
maybe something like the script at the end of this patch
http://bugs.gentoo.org/attachment.cgi?id=82955&action=view

to setup this wrapper we could introduce something like prep_ml_includes


open questions:
Q:how do we know when a package needs a certain abi?
A:we activate them via useflags


Q:how can we keep open an update path?
A:


Q:should the pm set CPPFLAGS (C preprocessor flags)? can these flags influence
the configure step?
A:
